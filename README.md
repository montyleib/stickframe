This is a clone of mathcodeprint/stickframe from gitlab, created and apparantly abandoned by Paul Randall.
I am going to try to continue the development of the workbench.

StickFrame:

A FreeCAD Workbench to aide in the modeling of US Stick Frame Construction. The workbench contains various predefined wooden construction members to speed the process of assembling the frame of a home or other wooden structure.

Installation
This Workbench is not available from the Installer in FreeCAD, you must place the files in your Mod directory.

    For Linux:

    /home/username/.FreeCAD/Mod/ 

    For Windows:

    C:\Program Files\FreeCAD\Mod\

    For Mac:

    /Applications/FreeCAD/Mod/
